The major feature is that, by making use of the characteristics of the NAND flash channel, the proposed algorithm performs the message pre-processing (MP) scheme to effectively prevent the propagation of unreliable messages and speed up the propagation of reliable messages. Additionally, the VNBP-MP algorithm includes a treatment for oscillating variable nodes (VNs) to further accelerate decoding convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed VNBP-MP algorithm has a noticeable improvement in convergence speed without compromising the error-correction performance, compared with the existing algorithms.\\\"\"\n","pred_text = predict_text(model, tokenizer, input_text, 300)\n","print(\"Predicted Text:\",

The mechanism is used to inform the peer of the missing PDCP frames. The peer can then use the information to recover the missing frames.

The proposed technique utilizes array signal processing techniques and employs phased arrays to enhance the performance of the network. One of the key challenges in WSNs is synchronization, which is addressed by the proposed technique through the use of dual-frequency PDoA. The technique enables accurate synchronization of the nodes, which results in improved beamforming performance. The proposed technique is evaluated through simulations, which show that the technique outperforms existing techniques in terms of coverage, signal to noise ratio, and energy efficiency. The results of the simulation study demonstrate that the proposed beamforming technique is an effective solution for enhancing the performance of WSNs and improving the accuracy of sensor systems.\",\n          \"This paper introduces the concept of one pixel attack as a means of fooling deep neural networks. Perturbation methods are utilized to modify the color values of a single pixel in an image, which can have a significant impact on the network's ability to correctly recognize the image. This technique highlights the importance of network robustness, as even a small change can greatly affect the results. The study focuses on image recognition tasks, where color analysis plays a crucial role. The effectiveness of one pixel attack is demonstrated through experiments on several popular benchmark datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10. It is recommended that future research continue to examine potential vulnerabilities of neural networks to such additives, and identify methods for improving network defenses against these types of attacks.\",\n          \"Finding the rising stars is an interesting problem and has been recently studied in various domains including academic networks. This study formulates the problem of rising stars prediction as a machine learning task. This approach involves applying classification models to categorize features as co-authors, authors, and venues. The effectiveness of this categorization strategy is empirically analyzed. To test this approach, data from Pakistani researchers retrieved from Web of Sciences between 2008 to 2014 was used. Feature sets were calculated and classification techniques applied to predict rising star researchers. The researchers predicted by the proposed method are compared with top researchers of Pakistan in 2016 and 2017. The proposed technique successfully solves the problem of finding rising star researchers in computer sciences based on the authors' contribution, mutual influence, and venue citations scores.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pred_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":47}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# measure results\n","test_concat = pd.read_csv(\"./drive/MyDrive/ColabNotebooks/llm/llama_test_result.csv\", encoding='latin-1')\n","true_labels = test_concat['label'].tolist()\n","pred_labels = test_concat['pred_label'].tolist()\n","accuracy = accuracy_score(true_labels, pred_labels)\n","precision = precision_score(true_labels, pred_labels, average='macro')\n","recall = recall_score(true_labels, pred_labels, average='macro')\n","f1 = f1_score(true_labels, pred_labels, average='macro')\n","conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(true_labels, pred_labels) # confusion matrix\n","\n","print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n","print(\"Precision:\", precision)\n","print(\"Recall:\", recall)\n","print(\"F1-score:\", f1)\n","print(\"Confusion Matrix:\", conf_matrix)"],"metadata":{"id":"RYjp9dlII6yR","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714541275786,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":355,"user":{"displayName":"Christine Xu","userId":"02332147294515990252"}},"outputId":"fcb2ac7b-a0db-4a19-bb80-8c822f582516"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy: 0.6539440203562341\n","Precision: 0.5\n","Recall: 0.32697201017811706\n","F1-score: 0.3953846153846154\n","Confusion Matrix: [[1285  680]\n"," [   0    0]]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1344: UndefinedMetricWarning: Recall is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no true samples.
